            <h1>About The Tool</h1>
            <p>
              The Pennsylvania Voting Location Siting Tool aids election officials in the siting process by identifying optimal voting locations (Election Day and early voting) and drop boxes for half-mile grid squares across a county. Election officials are able to find specific locations for consideration in these areas using local knowledge of their county’s resources and needs. The Siting Tool also provides visualization of demographic and voter data at the community level in each of the state’s 44 most populous counties. These local data can be used to inform voter outreach and education efforts.
            </p>
              Note: The Tool sites the number of Election Day voting locations in the most recent comparable election publicly disclosed by the county elections office. The Tool sites the number of 2020 general election early voting locations and drop boxes publicly disclosed by the county elections office. The Siting Tool’s purpose is to model the location of voting sites as a baseline, not to suggest what number of voting locations best serves a community.
